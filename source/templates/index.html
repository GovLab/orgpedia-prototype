            <p>Are you looking to easily & anonymously report unsafe work conditions, find responsible contractors who take work safety seriously, or looking for information on companies and worksites that pose a risk to the public today?</p>
            <p>OrgPedia is a mobile phone-based early warning system that collects safety conditions from workers on sites - so that workers go home the way they came to work.</p>        
            <p>160 U.S. Workers Die Each Day From Hazardous Working Conditions. Many more suffer from deadly injuries that donâ€™t get reported. Now there is a way to track safety conditions across construction sites, and know which companies who are doing what it takes to create safe work environments.</p>
